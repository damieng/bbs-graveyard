1.  About this document
=======================

     1.1  What is this document?
     ---------------------------
     This document is a frequently asked questions and answers help file
     for the popular bulletin board software program RemoteAccess produced
     by Wantree Development/Andrew Milner.

     After spending a long time in various conferences about RemoteAccess
     I kept seeing the same questions come up time and time again and
     wondered why I hadn't seen a RemoteAccess FAQ.  So here it is!

     Note that setting up of extra software and protocols is not covered in
     this document as they can be found in the excellent Q&A4RAnn package
     available from many BBS's.

     This is only the first release so there's plenty to be added and no
     doubt a few mistakes, all constructive criticism, comments and ideas
     are appreaciated!  See '1.3  Contacting the author' for more information.


     1.2  Where can I get the latest copy?
     -------------------------------------
     At the moment I'm not aware of any site on the net I can post this to
     when new versions come out, but if you can offer this facility, please

2.  About RemoteAccess
======================

     2.1  What is RemoteAccess?
     --------------------------
     RemoteAccess is an electronic bulletin board system capable of
     maintaining and handling extensive file and messaging services
     thru modems and ISDN adapters.  It is available in both shareware
     and comercial packaged versions from 2 node to 255 node versions.


     2.2   Where can I get the latest copy of RemoteAccess?
     ------------------------------------------------------
     Most good BBS's carry a copy of RemoteAccess, but for up to date
     versions, try the following:

     Internet:       ra.fileshop.com
                     www.uti.com
     FidoNet:        2:254/99           FREQ: RA

     The Internet site also offer a demonstration copy of RemoteAccess Pro.
     The required files are RADEMO.ARJ and RADEMO.SER (the serial number).


     2.3   Where can I register RemoteAccess?
     ----------------------------------------
     United Kingdom:    Gary Smith / Flightpath BBS
                        You can also purchase the Hobbyist and Pro versions
                        of RemoteAccess from here.


     2.4   What are the various flavours of RemoteAccess?
     ----------------------------------------------------
     2.02sw        Standard shareware release, unregistered.
     2.02+         Same as 2.02sw but registered with a valid ra.key file.
     2.02 Hobby 5  Hobbyist 5 node version.
     2.02 Pro 2    Professional 2 node version.
     2.02 Pro 10   Professional 10 node version.
     2.02 Pro 255  Professional 255 node version.
     2.50b?        New beta version of RemoteAccess not available to the
                   public.


     2.5   How do I get a beta copy of RemoteAccess?
     -----------------------------------------------
     RemoteAccess has what is called a 'Closed' beta team as opposed to a
     'Public' beta team.  This means the beta testers are a select few chosen
     by Wantree Development/Andrew Milner.

     It has been known for Gamma versions (The in-between versions after beta
     but before the full release) to be released to the public.

3.  Setting up RemoteAccess
===========================

     3.1   What init string do I need for my modem?
     ----------------------------------------------
     This is not an easy question to answer as it depends on the modem and
     what options you want to set.  A few guidelines follow with the Hayes
     standard command for this option (check your modem's manual if you
     are unsure if it is fully Hayes compatible).

        Option                          Hayes command
        ---------------------------------------------
        Auto-answer off                 ATS0=0
        Allow lower speed connections   ATN1
        Return result codes             ATQ0
        Result codes as words           ATV1
        Full result codes               ATX4
        Reset on DTR transition         AT&D3
        Enable RTS/CTS flow             AT&K3
        Error control mode              AT&Q5
        CTS tracks RTS online           AT&R0
        Display modem-modem speed       ATW2
 
     If you put more than one command together you only need to specify one
     AT command at the start of the initialisation string.  You may also want
     to include the sequence v^~ at the start.  This will cause the modem to
     disconnect from the remote system if it has failed to hang up.

     I hope to include a list of init string in the future for this section,
     so please send them in! (Only if it works - don't forget to mention the
     make and model of modem too)


     3.2   What is a FOSSIL driver?
     ------------------------------
     FOSSIL is an acronym for "Fido/Opus/SEAdog Standard Interface Layer". 

     A FOSSIL driver is a software layer between various comms & BBS software
     and your serial port.  By keeping the software to using a FOSSIL you
     can in theory have any sort of non-standard serial device such as a
     high speed DigiBoard or Hayes ESP card and only need a FOSSIL driver
     that supports that card for all of your software to work.

     You must load your FOSSIL driver before loading RemoteAccess.  It is also
     recommended that you set any doors to use the FOSSIL driver if possible
     to minimize comms problems caused when shelling to external programs.

     It is highly recommended you use the FOSSIL's LOCK option if it has one
     to ensure that the software does not get confused.  For 14,400 modems
     it is suggested you lock at 19,200 or 38,400.  For 28,800 modems you
     can lock at 38,400 or above, but bear in mind that speeds above this
     (57,600 and 115,200) do not conform to the original FOSSIL 5 specification
     and may require doors to be set to 'Extended FOSSIL' (or they may not
     function correctly at all).

     There are a few well known and reliable FOSSIL drivers, with versions
     for both OS/2 and MS-DOS.  There are no known ones for Windows 95 at the
     moment although both X00 and BNU work with reasonable sucess under a
     single node environment.

     Title:    X00
     System:   MS-DOS
     Author:   Ray Gwinn
     Latest:   1.50 (1.53 public beta)
     FTP:      ftp.cdrom.com /pub/simtel/msdos/fossil/x00v150.zip
     Locking:  Use the XU LOCK command detailed in the documentation.
     Comments: Avoid versions 2.xx as there are a number of hacked versions
               floating around.

     Title:    BNU
     System:   MS-DOS
     Author:   David Nugent
     Latest:   1.70

     FidoNet:  3:632/348.0
     Locking:  Specify as part of ports parameters in CONFIG.SYS
     Comments: Awkward setup for non-standard IRQ's.

     FAX:      1-703-494-0595
     BBS:      1-703-494-0098 
     Locking:  Although it does not appear to be documented, you can lock
               the port in the OS/2 CONFIG.SYS by placing a : followed by
               the lock BPS rate after the COM port setting for the SIO.SYS
               line.  eg.  DEVICE=C:\SIO\SIO.SYS (COM2:57600)
     Comments: This excellent package replaces OS/2's entire serial support
               with a much better set of drivers including a virtual FOSSIL
               driver.  The unregistered version supports up to 4 serial
               ports.

     Comments: Supports up to 8 serial ports.


     3.3   Why does RemoteAccess get the bps rate wrong?
     ---------------------------------------------------
     If you are running RemoteAccess with a mailer, ensure your batch file
     and error levels are set correctly as this can cause all sorts of strange
     problems.

     The more common error though (on both standalone and mailer modes),
     is that the modem is setup to report DTE (computer-to-modem) speed.
     This is easy to spot if all of your callers happen to call in at the
     bps rate you have locked your FOSSIL driver to (ie. 19200).

     To correct this, check your modem's manual and set the option to report
     DCE (modem-to-modem) speed.  If your modem is fully Hayes compatible
     then the command ATW2 should set this option.
     

     3.4   How do I setup doors?
     ---------------------------
     RemoteAccess supports a number of dropfile formats.  They are:

        DOOR.SYS        Enhanced 52-line version
                        This is sometimes refered to as Wildcat 3 by doors.

        DORINFO1.DEF    This is sometimes refered to as QuickBBS by doors.
                        Note that RemoteAccess will always generate
                        a DORINFO1.DEF in the node directory and not
                        DORINFOn.DEF where n is the node number.  If the
                        door expects the DORINFOn.DEF style and you are
                        running less than 10 nodes, put the following
                        at the start of the batch file for the door:-
 
                        copy c:\ra\%1\dorinfo1.def c:\door\dorinfo%1.def

                        Ensure that the first parameter is *N in the
                        menu option's OPTDATA field.

        EXITINFO.BBS    This is not supported by most door games but a lot
                        of RemoteAccess specific utilities will use it.
                        Details of it's structure are in the Pascal file
                        structures that come with RemoteAccess.

     To run a batch file from menu option, set the OPTDATA field as follows:-

        *C /C batch.bat *M

     The *C and /C will inform RA to load the command interpretor and to return
     once the batch file (batch.bat in the above example) has completed.


     3.5   Why do my JAM mail areas not work?
     ----------------------------------------
     In order for the JAM mail format to work, SHARE.EXE (or it's equivalent
     VSHARE.386 under Windows for Workgroups) must be loaded.

     SHARE is a program which comes with Microsoft's MS-DOS, Novell/Digital
     Research's DR-DOS, IBM's PC-DOS and Novell's DOS 7.  It is not required
     under OS/2, Windows 95 or Windows NT.

     This program can be loaded as a DEVICE= line in your config.sys or
     as a program in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.  (Loading in your CONFIG.SYS saves
     256 bytes of memory).

     Examples:          DEVICE=C:\DOS\SHARE.EXE /F:5100 /L:500  (CONFIG.SYS)
                        SHARE /F:5100 /L:500                    (AUTOEXEC.BAT)

4.  Advanced RemoteAccess features
==================================

     4.1   Why does the conferencing not work?
     -----------------------------------------
     The shareware version and registered shareware version of RemoteAccess do
     not include the multi-line conferencing option despite the references which
     can be found in the documentation for these versions.

     The multi-line conferencing is available in the Hobbyist 5-node and
     Professional versions of RemoteAccess.


     4.2   How can I run more than 1 node?
     -------------------------------------
     There are two basic ways of doing this.  The first is to network together
     PC's and to run a node on each but this is outside the scope of this FAQ.

     The second and more popular option is to multitask the machine to allow it to
     run more than 1 DOS session simultaneously.  There are a number of multitaskers
     on the market, each is detailed with it's good and bad points below:

     Name:     DESQview
     Producer: QuarterDeck
     Good:     Sit's on top of existing DOS system
               Pre-emptive multitasking.
               Requires little in the way of RAM.
     Bad:      Each DOS session restricted conventional memory.
               Not as stable as it could be.
     Comments: DESQview is quite a good little multitasker.  I used it to run my
               BBS for a couple of months and found that it did the job quite well
               and at a reasonable speed with 2 nodes on a 486SX/25 with 4mb RAM.

     Name:     Windows 3.1/3.11
     Producer: Microsoft
     Good:     Lets you run Windows apps while your BBS runs.
     Bad:      Windows comms support is terrible.
               Can be awkward to get it up and running.
               Runs quite slow.
     Comments: I've not tried this myself but have heard from people that run it
               okay although it does require some fiddling to get it working.

     Name:     OS/2 Warp
     Producer: IBM
     Good:     Two virtual FOSSIL drivers available.
               Can be very stable once setup.
     Bad:      Requires quite a lot of RAM (8mb for 2 nodes)
               Quite slow on 486sx machines with 2 nodes.
     Comments: I still run my system under Warp as I'm often away for a few days
               and I need to know it will be running still when I get back.  

     Name:     Windows NT
     Producer: Microsoft
     Good:     It's solid.
     Bad:      I've not heard of anybody managing this one!
     Comments: It may not be possible.

     Name:     Novell DOS 7
     Producer: Novell
     Good:     DPMI dos with a built in multitasker!
               Peer-to-peer networking!
     Bad:      Novell do not support background comms in the multitasker!

     Name:     Windows 95
     Producer: Microsoft
     Good:     It's fast.
               It lets you run Windows apps.
     Bad:      May have problems running more than one node - people still
               experiencing some problems.
     Comments: I've had a single node run fine but multinode seems to cause
               the machine to hang on the second session when loading X00/BNU
               for a second time in a DOS Window.  Loading them before 95
               causes 95 to seize the COM port for no reason (this may be
               fixed in a later build?)
