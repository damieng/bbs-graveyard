Introduction to RACDK
---------------------
The RemoteAccess 'C' Developer Kit (or RACDK), is a set of files to assist
with developing applications for use with the popular bulletin-board package,
RemoteAccess.

Currently included are the RemoteAccess structures converted to 'C' from
Pascal, routines for converting Pascal strings to and from C strings,
multitasking timeslicing, CRC calculations and a few examples to get you
started.

                         Reading RA files

Requirements
------------
To use RACDK you require:

o    A 'C' language compiler.  RACDK has only been tested with Borland C++
     v4.52
o    A copy of RemoteAccess 2.01, 2.02 or 2.50 Shareware, Hobby or
     Professional configured & working is recommended.
o    Experience with 'C' programming.

Note: The 'C' source files contained within this package have been developed
using Borland C++ v4.52 only.  Other compilers may interpret this code in such
a way that it no longer functions correctly (Common problems include different
compilers ideas about longs, ints etc).

Setting up RA-Monitor
---------------------
To setup RACDK simply unpack the files to a directory.  You may want to put
the .H files into your 'C' compilers include directory, or add the RACDK path
to your compiler's list of include directories.


Using RACDK
===========

Structures
----------
The RA250C.H file included with the package is the core of the RACDK.  It
defines, in 'C', the structure of the RemoteAccess data & control files so
that you may read and write information to work with the RemoteAccess software.
This file is based on information in the Pascal structures file included with
all releases of RemoteAccess.

There are many files described in the structures document, a listing of them
appears in the following section Overview of files.  A simple example of
accessing a RemoteAccess file in 'C' using the RACDK can be found in the
included FILEDEMO.C file.


Functions
---------
The RACDK.H file contains functions which you may find of some use while
developing applications to work with RemoteAccess.  You may either include
this file in your project with #include or manually copy and paste the
routines into your own code.  The functions are detailed below however
additional detailed information can be found at the start of RACDK.H.

CRC32 - Calculate 32-bit CRC
Prototype:	unsigned long CRC32(unsigned char *pBuffer,unsigned int iBufLen)
Input:		*pBuffer	Pointer to area of memory to calculate CRC from
               iBufLen   Length of pBuffer (number of bytes to process)
Output:		32-bit CRC code for memory block
Description:	This routine generates a 32-bit CRC code from a block of data.
               You can pass this routine a block of text such as a password
               and it will generate the same CRC code as RemoteAccess does
               when changing a password.  This is also used to encode user
               names for fast lookup as well as in the JAM message base and
               on Z-Modem transfer packets.
Example:       USERrec.PasswordCRC = CRC32(myPass,strlen(myPass));
               This would store the password contained in the string myPass in
               a USER.BBS record ready to be written back to USERS.BBS itself.
Note:		This routine uses 'C' string types, to use it on Pascal types,
               see the section titled 'Pascal string handling' later in this
               document.

TimeSlice - Release timeslice to multitasking OS
Prototype:	void TimeSlice(void)
Input:		None
Output:		None
Description:	This routine will attempt to detect DESQview, OS/2 or Windows
               multitasking operating systems and will release a timeslice to
               each of them when called.  If none are found this routine will
               release timeslices using the generic method of executing
               assembler NUL instructions.
Example:       while(!kbhit()) TimeSlice();
               This would wait for a key to be pressed but will take minimal
               CPU usage while waiting.
Note:		This function will compile only in compilers which support
               inline assembler.
               This function will run only in DOS applications with Intel
               80x86 support.


Pascal string handling
----------------------
Pascal handles strings differently to 'C'.  In 'C' a string consists of a
sequence of characters with the null character (00h) telling 'C' when the
string finishes.  This has the advantage of allowing unlimited length strings
at the expensive of not being able to tell how long the string is until you
have read every character in it (this is what the strlen() function does).

Pascal strings are stored differently.  Instead of being null-terminated the
first actual byte contains the length of the string, followed by the string
itself.  For example:-

'C'		unsigned char sUserName[61];
		strcpy(sFileName,"Guard");
		In memory (hex):	477561726400

Pascal    sUserName: String[5];
		sUserName := 'Guard';
		In memory(hex):	054775617264

It is important to note that as Pascal stores this length that you do not read
more characters than specified as often Pascal will overwrite only part of a
string.  For example if a Pascal field contained the string 'This is a test'
and then later contained the string 'What' if you went and uses the entire
contents of the field instead of the first 4 characters specified you would
possibly get 'What is a test'.

To help relieve this problem the RACDK contains four macros for managing
Pascal <> 'C ' string conversions.  These are implemented as macros for
optimum speed but you are free to convert them to functions (but do not
redistribute these functions with the RACDK).

The macros are as follows:

	Pas2C		Convert Pascal string to 'C' format
                    Example:  Pas2C(CONFIGrec.SysopName);
                              printf("Sysop is %s\n",CONFIGrec.SysopName);
	C2Pas		Convert 'C' string to Pascal format
                    Example:  C2Pas(CONFIGrec.SysopName);
                              fwrite...
     cpyPas2C       Copy a Pascal string into a 'C' string
                    Example:  cpyPas2C(CONFIGrec.SysopName,sSysopName);
                              printf("Sysop is %s\n",sSysopName);
     cpyC2Pas       Copy a 'C' string to a Pascal string
                    Example:  cpyC2Pas(sSysopName,CONFIGrec.SysopName);
                              fwrite...

General tips
------------

Files
ú    Always open the files in shared mode.
ú	Open a file, read it's contents and close ASAP to prevent RA from being
     locked-out.
ú	Some files have multiple records.  What this means is that the same
     information is stored multiple times.  For example, the CONFIGrecord
     found in CONFIG.RA is only stored once - the CONFIGrecord described all
     the fields contained within this file and matches it exactly.  However,
     the FILESrecord found in FILES.RA is stored many many times, one for each
     file area.  You can choose which area you read using the 'C' function
     fseek before reading.  fseek is based on moving the files current
     position by a number of bytes so to get to a specific record you
     calculate the position as (recordnumber-1)*sizeof(record).

Interface
ú	Making your program appear to the sysops using an RA style interface is a
     great way to make them feel immediately at home.  If your application
     does uses this interface then you should include something like
     'Original interface design by Joaquim Homrighausen' in the documentation.
ú	Always release timeslices when posssible, especially when waiting for a
     key-press.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------
Q:	The configuration files are reading in garbage, why?
A:	Ensure you are loading the correct file properly.  If you are sure you are
     loading it correctly then you MUST make sure that your compiler has the
     option for ENUM as character and not ENUM as integer which is the default
     on some 'C' compilers including Borland C++.

Future enhancements
-------------------
Expect some more example programs and a greatly expanded function library
(Note sending, checking user online etc) maybe even complete little
applications to show various functions.  If you want to see a product that
has used RACDK, our own FREEWARE RA-Monitor tool uses this package (shows
status of all nodes, send notes, log off users) can be FREQ'ed from our
FidoNet address as RAMON or retrieved from our WWW site on the Internet.  As
of writing the latest version is 1.00.


Other sources
-------------
There are many other archives which you may find useful when developing
applications for RemoteAccess in 'C', a couple of the most useful ones are
listed here and should be available from any good BBS (and are available on
our BBS once your account has been validated):

Messages
JAM-API	Set of 'C' and Pascal routines for manipulating the JAM message
		base including reading/writing messages.  Also includes HMB2JAM
		message base converter with source code which is useful if you want
		to know how to read Hudson message bases.

Doors
OpenDoors	OpenDoors v6 is an excellent library for 'C'/'C++' which lets you
          write a BBS door almost as easily as writing a normal DOS 'C'
          program.
