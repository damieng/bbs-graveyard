Introduction

Introduction to RA-Monitor

RemoteAccess Monitor (or RA-Monitor), is a monitoring & control program for 
the popular bulletin-board package, RemoteAccess.

RA-Monitor allows you to monitor the status of your BBS, see who is logged in, 
and what they are currently doing.  In addition, you can send online messages 
to nodes, log them off or display detailed information about their current 
login.  All of this functionality is provided in a full DOS windowed 
environment allowing you to have multiple windows open with resizing & 
movement while retaining the familiar interface of the RemoteAccess tools such 
as RAMGR or RACONFIG.

RA-Monitor is also extremely easy to setup.  It will run straight from the 
package without configuration, reading necessary information such as display 
settings and number of nodes.  The included configuration program can be used 
to fine-tune settings for some features.

Requirements

To use RA-Monitor you require:

o       An IBM-compatible personal computer with a 286, 386, 486 or Pentium 
	processor.
o       A storage device with approximately 200k free.
o       Approximately 300kb of conventional memory.
o       A copy of RemoteAccess 2.01, 2.02 or 2.50 Shareware, Hobby or 
	Professional configured & working.
o       A DOS session (either MS-DOS/PC-DOS or a VDM provided by Windows, 95, 
	NT or IBM OS/2)

A mouse with standard DOS support is highly recommended. 


Setting up RA-Monitor

Unpack or copy the RA-Monitor files contained within this package to a 
directory on your system.  There is no need to place these files in your main 
RA directory nor to be part of your path.

Once you have copied the files, RA-Monitor can be run by typing RAMON.  This 
will load the RA-Monitor software with it's preset defaults, described in a 
moment.

You can change these settings by using the included RAMSETUP program.  The 
settings are:

Refresh Interval (Default: 2 seconds)
This setting determines how often RA-Monitor refreshes the screen.  On systems 
with either a large number of nodes or a slow network, you may need to lower 
this setting to 3-4 to ensure that RA-Monitor runs smoothly.  On systems with 
less nodes (typically less than 20) you can change this setting to 1 second 
to make RA-Monitor more responsive with it's status information.

Node Template (Default: '\NODE*N')
This determines where RA-Monitor can find node-specific information about your 
BBS.  This template is appended to the main RA directory name.  These 
directories will be the directory you "CD" into in your batch file before 
running RA with the -N<node> parameter.  

If you are not running a multi-line system and you CD into the RA directory 
running RA without the -N<node> paramter, then you will need to ensure this 
field is blank.

The *N in this field will expand to the node number in plain decimal with no 
padding.  e.g. The default "\NODE^N" parameter if RA was set to "C:\RA" would 
become C:\RA\NODE1 for node 1, C:\RA\NODE255 for node 255.

*N does not have to be the last two characters of this field, templates such 
as \*NLINE would give C:\RA\1LINE for node 1 and C:\RA\255LINE for node 255.

Exit Error Level (Default: 0)
This setting tells RA-Monitor what your normal error-level is for exiting 
RemoteAccess.  If you use the -E<level> parameter to launch RemoteAccess then 
you should enter that error-level here.  If you do not use the -E parameter 
with RemoteAccess then this field should be left to it's default of 0.

Mouse Support (Default: FULL)
It is recommended that you use a mouse with RA-Monitor to allow movement & 
resizing of the windows it supports.  Unless you are having problems with 
RA-Monitor then leave this parameter on "FULL".  "PARTIAL" will make 
mouse-movements fake keystrokes providing only a basic interface with none of 
the windowing control support and "NONE" will prevent any mouse functions from 
being detected or used.

UserDoes Support (Default: IGNORE)
If you set this option to "SHOW" then RA-Monitor will display the ASCII 
contents of the file USERDOES.n (n=node) from the RA semaphore directory on 
the node information screen.  UserDoes files are extended "Node status" files 
which are used by a number of utilities.  They can be created like: 

echo Playing Red Dragon > C:\RA\SEMA\USERDOES.%1

which you may want to put in a batch file when launching doors etc.  If you 
have no need for this support, just select "IGNORE" (the default anyway) and 
RA-Monitor will behave as if they do not exist.

Date Format (Default: English)
This will allow you to choose between two common date formats to be used when 
displaying the date in the Node Information Window within RA-Monitor.  The 
choices are English (DD/MM/YY) and American (MM/DD/YY).  We realise that other 
countries use these formats too but have chosen these names for clarity.

RA-Monitor also supports special screen handling which is automatically read 
from the RemoteAccess configuration files.  These are:

		Screen writes           Direct/BIOS
		Colour mode             Colour/Mono
		Snow checking           On/Off
		Multitasker             Note: Only "AUTO", "Windows", "OS/2" 
					and "DESQview" settings are utilised 
					by RA-Monitor.  All other settings 
					will disable multitasking.

If you wish to change these settings then use RACONFIG.  To change for *just* 
RA-Monitor, copy the CONFIG.RA file from RemoteAccess into your RA-Monitor 
directory then "CD" to the RA-Monitor directory and run RACONFIG as you would 
do for individual node settings.


Using RA-Monitor

The environment

RA-Monitor uses a full text-windowing environment to allow the screen to be 
positioned and resized to suit your requirements.  These functions require 
full mouse support and are controlled as follows:

	To move a window:       Position the cursor to the top bar of a window 
				and drag it to the required position using the 
				left mouse button.
	To close a window:      Some windows have a yellow square block at the 
				top left-hand side of the window.  Clicking 
				this with the left mouse button will close 
				that window.
	To resize a window:     Clicking the bottom-right corner of a window 
				will allow you to resize it to a more 
				convenient size.  Simply hold down the left 
				mouse button and the window will resize as 
				you move the mouse.
	To scroll a window:     If the contents of the window exceed the size 
				of the frame in which it is contained, arrows 
				will appear in the windows frame which allow 
				you to scroll the viewable area over it's 
				contents.

When you load RA-Monitor, it should display a window on the screen displaying 
the current node status of your screens.  


Status window

This will be automatically centered and auto-size to display as many of your 
nodes as possible.  If you have more nodes than RA-Monitor can fit into the 
display, scroll arrows will appear in the left hand side of the windows frame 
allowing you to scroll the area.  The window will have the title "Status" in 
the top-right corner of the frame.

An simple example is shown here:

RemoteAccess MONITOR 1.21                                             12:29:51

  +--------------------------------------------------------------- Status +
  |  Node  User                  BPS    Location            Status        |
  |    1   Damien Guard              0  Black Ice HQ        Browsing      |
  |    2   [Ready]                   0  InterMail           Ready         |
  |    3   --- Offline ---           0                                    |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The selection highlight can be moved with either the cursor keys, by selecting 
with the mouse or by pressing numbers 1-9 to jump to a specific node (for the 
first nine nodes only).  By pressing either the mouse button or return you can 
bring up the control window, described in a moment, which can perform 
operations on the selected node.

As this tools if for use by a sysop, hidden callers are displayed in this 
list.

The fields shown on this screen are: 

     Node            BBS node or line for which this information pertains to.
     User            Name of the user currently online or may contain status 
		     information if nobody is currently logged into this node.
     BPS             User's login speed or BPS.  This is sometimes incorrectly 
		     referred to as baud.
     Location        User's location, or may contain the words 'RemoteAccess' 
		     if RA is currently waiting without a user.
     Status          Current activity of the user.  May contain standard 
		     entries such as Browsing or File transfer, but can also 
		     contain custom entries for doors using the *A option.


Control window

The control window will allow you to view & control your RemoteAccess system 
in conjunction with the node information screen.  The options on this menu 
are:

      Node info       Displays detailed node information for the current node 
		      using the Node Information window described below.
      Send note       Sends an "Online Note" to the user much the same was as
		      RemoteAccess's menu type xx.
      Log off         Logs the user off BBS, exiting RemoteAccess at the error 
		      level specified in RAMSETUP.
      BBS info        Displays some information about your BBS using the BBS 
		      Information window described below.
      About           Displays credits & version number for RA-Monitor.
      Quit            Exit RA-Monitor and return to DOS.

The options can be selected by either the mouse, the cursor keys & return or 
by pressing the first letter of the option.  Note: You can press the first 
letter of the option from the Node Information window even if the Control 
window is not visible/open.

The Node info & BBS info options toggle whether their relative window is 
displayed allowing you to display & remove the windows from the keyboard.


Node Information window

The Node Information window displays information about the currently selected 
node.  Note, you can display this window and still move through the Status 
window and it will update to reflect the currently selected node in the 
Status window.  The details are as follows:

	Node number     Node for which this information pertains to.
	User name       Name of the user currently using this node.
	User handle     Handle of the user currently using this node.
	Location        Location of the user currently using this node.
	BPS             Connect BPS speed of the caller using this node.
			Note: 0 indicates this call is a LOCAL login.
	User call       Number of times this user has logged into your BBS.
	Currently       User's current activity on this node.
	Hidden user     Whether this user is currently hidden to other 
			callers.
	Paged sysop     Whether this user has paged the sysop using this 
			session.
	No disturb      Whether this user has the "do not disturb" flag set 
			to ignore online notes from other users.
	Exit pending    Whether this node has already been sent a "Log off" 
			code from RA-Monitor and is waiting for RemoteAccess 
			to process it.
	Note pending    Whether this node has been sent a "Online Note" either 
			via RA-Monitor or RemoteAccess that has not yet been 
			read.
	Logged in at    Time and date this user logged in.
	Previous call   Time and date of the most recent logoff of this node.
			Do not confuse with the users previous call.
	User does       If you have UserDoes support enabled in RAMSETUP and 
			there is a valid UserDoes status information for this 
			node, the first 80 characters will be displayed here.

NOTE:   Both exit & notes pending will normally occur when the user is in a 
door as RemoteAccess is unable to process them until control has returned to 
RemoteAccess itself.   


BBS Information window

The BBS Information window displays some simple information about your BBS.  
This information is:

	Total nodes     Number of nodes that RA-Monitor has detected.
	Total calls     Total number of calls your BBS has received in total.
	Calls today     Number of calls your BBS has received today.
	Last caller     Name of the last caller to log off your system.


RAStatus
RAStatus is an additional DOS based tool included in this package which allows 
you to modify the RemoteAccess status information which is shown both on 
RA-Monitor and the "Who's Online" function in RemoteAccess.

The syntax for this tool is:    RASTATUS /N<node> [options]
				Where <node> is the node number you wish to 
				modify.

The options are:    /U<user name>           Change 'user name' to this text.
		    /H<handle>              Change 'user handle' to this text.
		    /B<bps>                 Change 'BPS rate' to this speed.
					    (Use 0 for local, no commas!)
		    /L<location>            Change 'users location' to this 
					    text.
		    /S<status>              Change 'currently doing' to this 
					    text.
					    (RemoteAccess limitation of 10 
					    characters)
		    /C<call>                Change 'times-called' to this 
					    value.
		    /D<text>                Write this text to this nodes 
					    userdoes.
		    /X                      Clear this node's information.

Due to the way DOS works, if you require a name/location etc to have a space 
in it, please use the underscore character '_' - RAStatus will convert this 
to spaces as it updates the status information.

Please note that changing these options only affects the online status lists 
and does not modify the users record (for example specifying 
		RASTATUS /N1 /LNot_here 
will only adjust the online list - the user's own Location will remain 
whatever it is set to in RemoteAccess' user database).

Frequently asked questions

Q:      The settings in RemoteAccess for screen & multitasking settings are 
	correct for my BBS but I use RA-Monitor on a different machine.  How 
	can I change them?
A:      Copy CONFIG.RA from your RA system directory to RA-Monitor's 
	directory.  CD into RA-Monitor's directory and run RACONFIG.  Adjust 
	the settings in this copy of CONFIG.RA.  RA-Monitor will first use the 
	current directory's CONFIG.RA before searching the RA main directory.

Q:      RA-Monitor hangs on my system.
A:      Try disabling mouse support in RAMSETUP.  If this fails use the above 
	answer to create a CONFIG.RA in RA-Monitor's directory and try setting 
	the multitasker to AT BIOS.  If neither of these solutions help, fill 
	in PROBLEM.DOC enclosed in this package and send it to Envy 
	Technologies (contact details in the following section).

Q:      RA-Monitor has several "--- Offline ---" lines at the end of the 
	status display list.
A:      Delete your USERON.BBS file from RemoteAccess and log-in to the 
	highest node number your BBS has.  This will rebuild the USERON.BBS 
	file to the correct size so that RA-Monitor can calculate how many 
	nodes your system is capable of running.
