# Graveyard
Over the many years I have written code for many systems.  This repo contains the source code for various obsolete tools I have written.

They are entirely provided as-is and getting them to compile is no mean feat. The DOS based tools will require Borland Turbo C++ 3.1, the Windows tools versions of Delphi from 2.0 to 4.0 and the BeOS ones require Metrowerks for BeOS.

Additionally there are some missing dependencies. Getting the RemoteAccess tools to work requires a working RemoteAccess BBS and the two doors require the OpenDoor library. RA-Monitor also requires a custom version of 'LVS Windows' by 'Lake View Software' in Ohio who have long since disappeared and while I have the source it's not mine to publish.  Monitor/RA probably requires a third-party library for the toolbar control etc.
