# Graveyard
Over the many years I have written code for many systems.  This repo contains the source code for various obsolete tools I have written.

They are provided as-is and getting them to compile is no mean feat. The DOS based tools will require Borland Turbo C++ 3.1, the Windows tools versions of Delphi from 2.0 to 4.0 and the BeOS ones require Metrowerks for BeOS.

Additionally there are missing dependencies. Getting the RemoteAccess tools to work requires a working RemoteAccess BBS and the two doors require the OpenDoor library. RA-Monitor also requires a custom version of 'LVS Windows' by 'Lake View Software' in Ohio who have long since disappeared and while I have the source it's not mine to publish. 

Binaries for many of the tools can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/damieng/graveyard/releases/tag/1.0)
