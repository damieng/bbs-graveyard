WARNING
-------
Although I am making this code available free (and without warranty), 
Apple own the look and feel of their operating system although I have seen plenty
of web sites and Windows programs (WinMac, Photoshop...) use the Apple Macintosh 
interface.  Still if you are going to write something commercial for sale I'm
sure Apple would be very interested - for legal reasons you may want to contact
them at http://www.apple.com
